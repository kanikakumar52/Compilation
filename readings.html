			<h2>READING RESPONSES</h2>
				
			<p>The following sections and reading responses to the various readings that were assigned during the semeser. I found these readings a great addition to the course beavuse they pushed me to think further about my design decisions and helped me understand the world of coding a lot better.</p>

				<p class="title">What is Code? & What Screens Want:</p>

				<p class="response">Interesting how the What is Code? article draws the reader in by placing them as a person in the conversation. This is a great way to start off the reading by piquing the reader’s interest and urging them to read on. The article does a good job of addressing all the different kinds of questions skeptics would have about a website redesign and the best way to address these concerns. One very important thing that the reading mentions is the importance of iconography- in this case, the shopping cart icon and additional features that make the cart page more accessible. Further, the article allows the reader to understand computers in a different way. For instance, the section about each key on a keyboard sending a scancode is particularly interesting because it reminds the reader how much a computer processes in a split second. I particularly enjoyed the interactivity of the graphics in the reading, specifically the keyboard section that illustrated the text perfectly. I also enjoyed the debugging section where I was able to test my coding knowledge.</p>

				<p class="response">Another very interesting section of this reading was the section about selecting coding languages and the pros and cons of each. I found this particularly interesting because I have often wondered why programmers work with specific languages and why there are so many to start with. It was interesting to understand how certain languages pose limitations, while others work perfectly for specific programming tasks. I was also unaware that different languages run at different speeds. One interesting portion was understanding the difference between Java and Javascript. I would be interested to learn both language and thereafter truly understand that they are only linked by name.</p> 

				<p class="response">The Frank Chimero reading is written a lot more formally than the previous reading. I enjoyed the aspirin example because it really put things about technological advancement in perspective. It is interesting to relate the aspirin example to coding and how that explains why we use language instead of coding in machine language. The padding is the middle ground that we use to input instructions. I found this reading a bit more difficult to get into because of the excessive white space. The large titles were also very distracting and made me lose my train of thought if I started to think deeper about a certain topic. This website definitely needs to be designed better for people to get into the text and respond to it. The previous reading was a lot easier to focus on because the text was the right size and closer together. Further, the frequent interactive sections made the reading more fun, and less like a 38,000 word essay. However, I did enjoy the color break sections which broke up the text a lot better than the Paul Ford article.</p>

				<p class="title">A vernacular web:<p>

				<p class="response">I enjoyed this article first and foremost because of how well and descriptively it was written. Olia consciously writes in a storytelling format to keep the reader hooked along the storyline rather than view the text as paragraphs of fact. The article reiterates the extent to which the web has changed- it now caters towards any and every need, compared to the past when a select audience made use of it. It is certainly interesting to think about a time before my own when people managed without the internet. I like her use of the word “amateur”- it perfectly describes the beginnings of the web while acknowledging its scope for growth. I loved her comparison between web designs and fashion, especially because it relates to the web trends assignment we are currently working on. Much like fashion, web trends constantly change but also tend to reappear over time. Certain trends even render themselves themselves timeless.</p>

				<p class="title">Jodi’s Infrastructure:</p>

				<p class="response">I liked the layout of this article a lot more- the white space made it an easier read and the full bleed images held my attention. It was interesting to think of the different http layouts and pieces of art rather than urls. It certainly raises the question of what constitutes as art, and how something can be seen as beautiful and meaningful regardless of the medium. It definitely changes things to think of code as beautiful- makes me think a lot deeper about how consciously programmers lay out their code. Not only does it read better, bit it also looks more visually pleasing. One might even think of programmers as artists to some extent. I enjoyed the section about different languages and characters having the same underlying ASCII language. It certainly made me think about how difficult it is to create a new coding language that caters to different languages, emoticons and expressions regardless of user geography. The article makes a key point of comparing the web to fractals and how new webpages act as tiny additions to the ever growing fractal network. I have always been fascinated by fractals, so particularly loved this comparison. It helped me understand the complexity of the web just a little bit better.</p>

			<p class="title">Capitalism vs. Privacy:</p>

			<p class="response">I found this article particularly interesting because it addresses what everyone is concerned about in this day and age. Almost everyone has their laptop cameras covered and most people monitor how their computers manage to cater adds towards them based on conversations they’ve had near their devices. It is certainly a scary time and there is so much we don’t know about how these large tech giants are monitoring us. That being said, I definitely maintain that while privacy is a thing of the past, these companies have so much data flowing in that it is hard for them to pay close attention to individual activities. Nevertheless, I agree with everything the article the article states. All this data is collected for targeted advertising, but could cause a fair amount of damage if it were to fall into the wrong hands. These tech giants seem to be underplaying the amount of power they have over their audience. I found the IBM example very interesting- while extreme, it served as a good example of how these companies have important data that can be used to cause harm. The article is written in a fairly hostile tone, but I think this is important to convey the slippery slope that technological advancement has put us on.</p>

			<p class="title">Critical Atlas of Internet:</p>

			<p class="response">I loved the layout of this article especially because it relates to some of the layouts I have been working on in my projects. I appreciated the use of “sticky” positioning for more interactive scrolling. This article is laid out more like a scientific report, and at a glance looks like it could be talking about some kind of particle theory. I must point out that the typography made it a bit difficult to read the heavier paragraphs. I did not enjoy reading this article as much as the previous one because I found it difficult to follow along. There is a lack of text and limited explanation as to what these series of images mean. Further, the article mentions that the cyberspace takes a physical form, and I agree with this. The internet exists well beyond our screens and influences everything around us. Everything is mapped and navigated, and even screen less objects can be tracked in some way or another. I found it interesting that this article referred to the internet as a slippery slope much like I pointed out during my reading reaction to the previous article. I enjoyed the use of the words “dark fiber highway” to describe the networks that large companies create to track their own data.</p>

			<p class="title">Internet Under Fire:</p>

			<p class="response">This reading was pretty similar to the previous reading about privacy. Same tone and approach to the internet of things. I enjoyed how the article highlights that the net can do some very interesting things such as offer movies on demand and music, but also that these things are the least of what it can do. It reminds us that the net is a powerful space that can do much more than we could even imagine- the article ties into the previous privacy reading here where it mentions connectivity without permission. Further, the article makes an interesting point that the internet is not owned by anyone, and yet only a select number of companies profit from its “super power” of connectivity without permission. If it isn’t owned by anyone, then will there come a time when we view the internet as an entity with a mind of its own. How much further can the internet grow before it starts to expand on its own. How much longer before we lost control of it? The article also tends to refer to the internet as a medium, but I have trouble viewing it as just a medium. To me, a medium is something that we can control, like paint or paper. But the internet is so much more and certainly something too immensely complicated for us to control. I feel like the internet has expanded so much in recent years that we have lost our opportunity to control it. </p>
