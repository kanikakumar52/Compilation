				<h2>LYRIC PROJECT: LA VIE EN ROSE</h2>
				<p>This was the first proper project we worked on and was all about illustrating different lyrics using different fonts and layouts. The idea was to feel the song through the presentation of the words. I chose "La Vie En Rose" by Louis Armstrong.</p>

				<h2>JMB PROJECT: BEETHOVEN</h2>
				<p>This project involved studying Josef Muller-Brockmannâ€™s beautiful posters. I decided to focus on his Beethoven series because of my love for music and also decided to experiment with animation techniques in CSS.</p>

				<h2>WEB TREND PROJECT: URTHY</h2>
				<p>This was our first Javascript project and we were asked to find a web trend we were drawn to and either emphasize or diminish it. I decided to focus on scroll animation to animate components of my own project. </p>

				<h2>RECORD PROJECT: BEATREVIEW</h2>
				<p>The aim of this project was to record something- I paired my love for horror movies and fascination with fluctuating heart rate to measure heart rate changes during a horror movie. I worked on three movies with two viewers including myself.</p>
